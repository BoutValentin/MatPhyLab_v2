The Ruby on Rails application build in the purpose to propose an easy to use website for students and professor.

### Environment:

This projects use: 

- yarn
- ruby (3.0.0)
- rails (6.1.4)

I advice you tu use [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to easly switch between ruby version.

### Install:

Start by cloning this repositories from [github](https://github.com/BoutValentin/MatPhyLab_v2) or [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/BoutValentin/matphylab).
Set your ruby version to the one specify in the [**environment section**](#environment).
You can now run ```bundle install``` and start the server by using ```rails server```.
